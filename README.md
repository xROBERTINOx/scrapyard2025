# YouTube Chaos Extension

A Chrome extension designed to be hilariously unhelpful. This extension adds frustrating but entertaining features to YouTube that deliberately disrupt your viewing experience.

## Features

- **Random Video Muting**: Randomly mutes your YouTube video for 2 seconds every 1-2 minutes
- **Random Video Switching**: Unexpectedly switches to a different recommended video every 30-180 seconds
- **Spin-to-Watch Wheel**: Replaces the YouTube homepage with a spinning wheel that randomly selects videos for you to watch

## Installation Instructions

1. **Download**: Download and unzip this extension
2. **Access Extensions Page**: Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. **Enable Developer Mode**: Toggle on "Developer mode" in the top-right corner
4. **Load the Extension**: Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension files
5. **Verify Installation**: The extension icon should appear in your browser toolbar

## How It Works

### Random Video Muting
While watching any YouTube video, the extension will occasionally mute your video for exactly 2 seconds. A notification will appear when muting occurs.

### Random Video Switching
The extension will randomly select a video from your recommendations and automatically switch to it after displaying a brief warning.

### Spin-to-Watch Wheel
When you visit the YouTube homepage:
1. A colorful spinning wheel replaces the normal content
2. Click the "SPIN" button to start the wheel
3. The wheel selects a random video for you to watch
4. Click "Reset" to spin again

## Why Use This Extension?

- You enjoy chaotic experiences
- You want to break out of your YouTube recommendation bubble
- You're tired of having control over your viewing experience

## Troubleshooting

If features aren't working:
- Make sure you're on an actual YouTube video page (not the homepage) for the muting and switching features
- Check that the extension is enabled
- Try refreshing the page
- Ensure no other extensions are blocking YouTube functionality
