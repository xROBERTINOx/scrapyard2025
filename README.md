# YouTube Chaos Extension
A Chrome extension designed to be hilariously unhelpful. This extension adds frustrating but entertaining features to YouTube that deliberately disrupt your viewing experience.

## Features
- **Random Video Muting**: Randomly mutes your YouTube video for 2 seconds every 1-2 minutes
- **Random Video Switching**: Unexpectedly switches to a different recommended video every 30-180 seconds
- **Spin-to-Watch Wheel**: Replaces the YouTube homepage with a spinning wheel that randomly selects videos for you to watch
- **Theater Mode Flipper**: Randomly switches between Default, Theater, and Fullscreen modes every minute
- **Fullscreen Disabler**: Option to prevent videos from entering fullscreen mode for those who prefer windowed viewing

## Installation Instructions

2. **Access Extensions Page**: Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. **Enable Developer Mode**: Toggle on "Developer mode" in the top-right corner
4. **Load the Extension**: Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension files
5. **Verify Installation**: The extension icon should appear in your browser toolbar

## How It Works
### Random Video Muting
While watching any YouTube video, the extension will occasionally mute your video for exactly 2 seconds. A notification will appear when muting occurs.

### Random Video Switching
The extension will randomly select a video from your recommendations and automatically switch to it after displaying a brief warning.

### Spin-to-Watch Wheel
When you visit the YouTube homepage:
1. A colorful spinning wheel replaces the normal content
2. Click the "SPIN" button to start the wheel
3. The wheel selects a random video for you to watch
4. Click "Reset" to spin again

### Theater Mode Flipper
While watching a video:
1. Every minute, the extension will randomly switch between default view, theater mode, and fullscreen
2. A notification appears before each switch
3. Adds an element of unpredictability to your viewing experience

### Fullscreen Disabler
1. Prevents videos from entering fullscreen mode
2. Useful for users who prefer to keep videos in windowed mode
3. Can be toggled on/off in the extension settings
